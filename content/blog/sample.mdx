Email has been the backbone of digital communication for decades, yet most email clients haven't evolved much since the early 2000s. Enter **Zero** - an open-source, AI-powered email solution that's reimagining how we interact with our inbox.

## What Makes Zero Different?

In a world dominated by closed-source email providers that harvest your data, Zero stands out with its commitment to:

### **Privacy First**
Your emails belong to you, not to big tech companies. Zero doesn't track, collect, or sell your data. With self-hosting capabilities, you maintain complete control over your communications and ensure compliance with the strictest data protection regulations.

- Host your own email infrastructure with enterprise-grade security
- Connect multiple email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Exchange, etc.) in one unified inbox
- Customize every aspect of your email experience through our extensible architecture
- Scale according to your needs, from individual use to enterprise deployments
